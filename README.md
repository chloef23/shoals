Analysis of productivity of Roseate Tern (ROST) colony on White and Seavey Island, ME. This analysis was conducted during a summer intership in 2022 and includes data between 2017 and 2022.  
The data used to conduct the analysis and the results are avalible with permission from Dr. Everett at UNH and Shoals Marine Laboratory.  

### Structure of the Analysis
- age.R compares the age of ROSTs across neighborhoods, or clusters of high density nests, in the colony
- comparison.R compares productivity and percent of terns that fledged as measures of ROST breeding success
- nests.R calculates the distribution of nests across neighborhoods and analyzes the relationship between nest density and percent terns fledged
- productivity.R calculates the percent of terns that fledged by neighborhood and year
- weather.R analyzes the effect of temperature during the breeding season of the percent of terns that fledged
